# Weather-App https://cslink05.github.io/Weather-App/
Weather App made with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript

This app uses data from the https://openweathermap.org/ API to render the current weather to the user's screen based on their geographical location.  

The clock at the top serves as a clock to be displayed to the user, but is also used in the conditional rendering of the page.

Based on the current weather and time of day, conditionals determine the correct SVG icon and a unique message to display to the user. The icons are from https://www.amcharts.com/free-animated-svg-weather-icons/.
